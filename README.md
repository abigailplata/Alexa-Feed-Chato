# Alexa, Feed Chato
An Arduino voice and remote controlled animal feeder written in C++ using Arduino 101, Alexa Voice Services, and Amazon Web Services. 

## Motivation
I was inspired to begin this project because at the beginning of this year my younger sister would wake up every morning at 5am before going to school just to feed her bunnies. I figured I'd create a phone app that would control an animal feeder, so this way she could just press a simple button from inside our home to feed her bunnies. This is currently an ongoing project I began at the start of the California Stay at Home order due to COVID-19. I have some  working, starting code for the Arduino and the application here and will be updating as I go. 

## Stages
1. Wire Breadboard to Arduino, Solenoid, and Bluefruit LE UART.
2. Build a weatherproof container for arduino and wiring. 
3. Code, code, code!
4. Test
5. Repeat 2-4 depending on test run.
